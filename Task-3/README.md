# Weather Extension for Jupyter Lab

A packaged JupyterLab extension ready to be installed, which provides the functionality of obtaining weather data of the world cities, with an ability to access the weather information inside a notebook cell. A Kernel Extension is created that creates variable inside
the user space. When printing this variable, the user is able to see the json with the weather information.
